## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📊 [step-criterion](https://github.com/MrRolie/step_criterion)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPI-step--criterion-blue)](https://pypi.org/project/step-criterion/)

**Educational and diagnostic stepwise model selection for statsmodels**

A Python package providing a unified, flexible interface for exploratory stepwise regression with multiple selection criteria (AIC, BIC, Adjusted R², p-values). Supports both OLS and GLM models with advanced features like interaction terms, transformations, and model averaging.

```python
pip install step-criterion
```

**Key Features:**
- Multiple criteria: AIC, BIC, Adjusted R², p-value based selection
- Model support: OLS and GLM (logistic, Poisson, Gamma)
- Advanced formulas: Interaction terms, polynomial transformations
- Model averaging with AIC/BIC weights
